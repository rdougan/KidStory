        "text": "Geppetto was a carpenter, who made things out of wood. He made chairs, tables, toys and dolls - you name it and he could! He liked his job; he had a lovely shop inside his home. But what he really wished for was a son to call his own.<br /><br />One day Geppetoo started cutting through a wooden square when suddenly he heard a small voice coming from somewhere. “Don’t cut me!” said the little voice. “Please spare me if you could.” It sounded like the voice was coming from the block of wood! Geppeto said, “I must be dreaming, there can’t be such a thing.” And carved the block of wood into a puppet on a string.<br /></br>Geppetto was so happy when his marionette was done. He though, “of all the dolls I’ve made, this is the nicest one.” He sewed the doll a big blue hat. He painted every toe and even gave the doll a name – it was Pinnochio."

        "text": "Geppetto and Pinocchio performed upon a stage. Their shows were very popular for kids of any age. But one day as they were on state – it was the strangest thing, the puppet danced all on its own – as if it had no string! <br /><br >Pinocchio was just like all other boys, but made of sturdy wood. And soon they were a common sight throughout the neighborhood: an old man walking down the street, with him a wooden boy who jumped and ran and leaped and danced, always full of joy."

        "text": "OneGeppetto loved Pinocchio as if the puppet was his son. Although the boy was made of wood, he was just like everyone. He went to school each morning, learned his lessons like the rest. And he loved to play with other boys – at soccer he was best. <br /><br />But sometimes he was naughty and did things that were wrong, like taking children’s toys that did not belong to him. Once, when Geppetto asked him, Pinocchio told a lie: “It wasn’t me!” he said, looking Geppetto in the eye. His nose began to grow and stretch, right then and there. And every time he lied, it would stretch further in the air. <br /><br />Pinocchio was a good boy, but sometimes he forgot that telling the truth is good behavior, and lying is not. When he didn’t tell the truth, his friends would quickly know, because every time he lied, his nose would start to grow! "
